# Catch Me If You Can ü•∑üèªüëÄ

A fast-paced, grid-based chase game built with Python and Pygame. Control your player (the white square labeled "P") and race to catch the elusive yellow square, avoiding obstacles and managing your score in a strategic environment.

---

## How to Play

- **Player:**  
  You are the white square with "P" written on it.

- **Goal:**  
  "Touch" the moving yellow square to win. The yellow square can pass through vertical walls, making it tricky to catch.

- **Obstacles:**  
  Red squares spawn randomly and block your movement. You cannot move through these squares.

- **Bomb Mechanic:**  
  Use a bomb to clear all red squares in a 3x3 area centered on your player.  
  **Note:** Using a bomb incurs a score penalty.

- **Special Rule:**  
  If you bomb the yellow target (i.e., if the bomb explosion covers the yellow square), **you instantly lose**.

- **Score System:**  
  Your score is always negative:
  - The magnitude increases over time (the longer you take, the lower your score).
  - Each bomb used further decreases your score.
